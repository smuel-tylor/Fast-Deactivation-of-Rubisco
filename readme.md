Custom scripts and analyses from Taylor et al Rubisco activation Nature Plants
==============================================================================

Written as an .Rproject in RStudio with R 4.1.1  
Version controlled using Git, with revisions pushed to GitHub  
Using renv to ensure reproducibility of package set up  
The Project should run smoothly in Rstudio, but there may be extra work required for those who do not use RStudio

  doi:

*/1_scripts_response_curves*
- cleaning data and fitting A/ci and A/Q response curves leaf by leaf

*/2_scripts_sun_shade_sun*
- fitting mixed effects models
  - multi-part models to activation state and Vcmax data
  - mixed effects for light response curve parameters (nlme[...].R)
  - Figures relating to these analyses
    - Limitation state analysis
    - Fitted light response curves
    - Fitted Activation State x time curves
    - Fitted Vcmax x time curves
    - Figure 1 for manuscript

*/3_scripts_diurnal_cowpea*
- diurnal models with alternative parameterisations of
  Rubisco activity half-times based on cowpea data
- Figure 2 for manuscript

*/4_source_scripts_AQ_Aci_Vcmaxt_diurnal*
- functions used for analyses in 1_..., 2_..., 3_...

*/5_scripts_light_rig_supplements*
- Drawing data components of supplementary figures that relate to light-rig
  validation experiments

*/output*
- Content not part of the GitHub submission, but output will be directed here,
  so needed for scripts to run
- When scripts are run, this will contain figures, tables, and .Rdata
  generated by the other scripts

*Runall.R* will source all of the scripts in the correct sequence and regenerate
all of the output into */output*
