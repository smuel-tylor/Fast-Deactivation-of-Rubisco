Custom scripts and analyses from the Nature Plants submission:
"Fast deactivation of Rubisco on sun to shade transitions in cowpea
drives a 26% loss in productivity"
The following set of subdirectories written for use as a .Rproject in RStudio
version control using Git and pushed to GitHub
and using renv to ensure reproducibility of package set up
Obviously, this all means that while the Project should run smoothly in Rstudio
there may be extra work required for those who do not use RStudio
